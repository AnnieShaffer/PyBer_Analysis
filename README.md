# Pyber Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the differences in PyBer ride fares over the different types of communities it services in order to give suggestions to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
From the data, we can see that PyBer has a much larger market in Urban areas, but the average fare per ride and per driver is significantly smaller than the other areas. This may be due to the shorter distances the customers need to go based on where they live.
