# Pyber Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the differences in PyBer ride fares over the different types of communities it services in order to give suggestions to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
From the data, we can see that PyBer has a much larger market in Urban areas, but the average fare per ride and per driver is significantly smaller than the other areas. This may be due to the shorter distances the customers need to go based on where they live. 

![Pyber Summary Data](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Resources/ride_sharing_data.png)

- Urban areas completed the most rides with 1,625, while rural areas completed the least amount of rides with 125. Suburban areas completed about one third of the rides in Urban areas with 625.

- Urban areas also have the largest amount of drivers with 2,405. Rural areas have the smallest number of drivers with 78 and suburban areas have just 490. 

- The total fares in the Urban community are again the highest at $39,854.38. This total is 9.2 times more than they rural communities total fares at $4,327.93 and 2.1 times higher than suburban areas at $19,356.33.

- The average fare per rider is highest for rural communities at $34.62. Suburban communities have an average fare of $30.97 and urban commities have the lowest rate at $24.53.

- The average fare per driver is highest in rural communities at $55.49. It is lowest in urban communities at $16.57 and suburban communities are in the middle at $39.50.

## Summary
I believe that the data shows that the rides and driver count for each community justify the price of each ride. 

- In urban communities, the average ride will be much shorter than one in a rural or suburban community based on how many people live in the community and the amount of areas that people frequent. There are also going to be less people with cars and higher demand for the PyBer product in these communities. If the price of the fare decreased, there may be even higher demand for the product in urban communities.

- Based on the number of rides in the given data, there are too many drivers in the Urban communities. There are 2,405 drivers in these communities, but only 1,625 total rides given. The total drivers in these Urban communities could be cut by 50% and still produce just as many rides efficiently. This will increase the average fare per driver to create a more even distribution between the communities.

- As shown in the graph, the data remains stagnant for most of the year with small peaks. This shows that the current status of the fares and drivers is consitant and can be followed if the company is looking for consistant returns.
